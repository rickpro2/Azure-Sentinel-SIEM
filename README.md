# SIEM-Honeypot



In this blog, I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. We will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map! LEARN THIS IN DEPTH AND PUT THIS ON YOUR RESUME!




# Cybersecurity Lab: Azure Sentinel and Honeypot Setup

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Cybersecurity Lab on setting up Azure Sentinel, a cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and a Virtual Machine Honeypot. This lab provides hands-on exposure to an SIEM without the need for corporate experience, offering insights into real-world cybersecurity scenarios. During the lab, I recorded the latitude and longitude of attackers and presented the data on a world map within the Azure environment.

- Add to the same region (West US 3)
- Select <b>Review + Create</b>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N3fwTkR.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="Log Analytics workspace"/>

> Custom logs with geographic information to map the locations of attackers will be absorbed into Log Analytics workspaces together with the Windows Event Viewer logs.

<h2>Step 4 : Setup Microsoft Defender for Cloud</h2>

- Search for "Microsoft Defender for Cloud"
- Under <b>Management</b> click on "Environment settings" -> Subscription Name -> Log Analytics Workspace Name (honeypot-law)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yXxSvyR.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Microsoft Defender"/>

<b>Settings | Defender plans</b>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t6jbVLT.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Microsoft Sentinel"/>

<h2>Step 7 : Turn OFF the Virtual Machine's firewall</h2>

> Testing Firewall - first we can test the firewall by pinging the VM's IP address. The purpose of this is to check if the target device with that specific IP address is reachable and responsive on the network. <b>"PING"</b> is a basic network troubleshooting tool used to test connectivity between your device and the target device.

<h4>For Windows:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open the Command Prompt: Press the Windows key, type "cmd," and press Enter to open the Command Prompt</li>
<li>Type the Ping Command: In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:</li>
</ol>
   
```ping (ip-adress)```

3. Replace <IP-address> with the actual IP address you want to ping. For example:

```ping 20.163.108.170```

<h4>For macOS and Linux</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open the Terminal: On macOS, you can find the Terminal in Applications > Utilities. On Linux, press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the Terminal.</li>
<li>Type the Ping Command: In the Terminal window, type the following command and press Enter:</li>
</ol>
   
```ping (ip-adress)```

3. Replace <IP-address> with the actual IP address you want to ping. For example:

```ping 20.163.108.170```

<h4>Both :</h4>

- Observe the Results: the ping command will start sending packets to the specified IP address, and you'll see the results with round-trip times and other statistics. To stop the ping process on both Windows and macOS/Linux, you can press Ctrl + C or Ctrl + Z
  
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/myGs1oV.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Microsoft Sentinel"/>

> As you can see above our firewall is set up to block out incoming ping requests. Next we will continue to disable the firewall...

- Locate the honeypot VM (honeypot-vm) under Virtual Machines.
- Copy the IP address from the VM 
- Using the credentials from step 2, access the virtual machine through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). <b>Note</b>: if your on a Mac you can download the "Microsoft Remote Desktop" application or use another VM host for Microsoft that supports the protocol.
- Accept Certificate warning
- Select NO for all <b>Choose privacy settings for your device</b>
- Hit Start and search for "wf.msc" (Windows Defender Firewall)
- Click "Windows Defender Firewall Properties"
- Turn Firewall State OFF for <b>Domain Profile | Private Profile | and Public Profile</b>
- Click Apply and Ok
- To check if VM is reachable, ping it using the command line of the host ```ping -t (ip-adress)```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D4uFicX.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="FIREWALL-OFF"/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GfIzOfe.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="pingsuccessful"/>

>Ping successful :)

<h2>Step 8 : Automating the Security Log Exporter</h2>

- In your VM launch Powershell ISE
- Configure Edge browser without logging in
- Copy <a href="https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab/blob/main/Custom_Security_Log_Exporter.ps1"> Powershell Script</a> and insert into Virtual Machine's Powershell (authored by Josh Madakor)
- Choose <b>New Script</b> in Powershell ISE and paste script
- Give it a name and save it to the desktop (log_exporter)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OCzbNAs.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="psscript"/>

- Create a profile with <a href="https://ipgeolocation.io/"> ipgeolocation.io</a>

> 1000 API calls per day are free with this account. A monthly cap of 150,000 API calls is available for 15 dollars.

- Once logged in, copy the API key and paste it into line 2 of the script. ```$API_KEY = "<API key>"```
- Click <b>Save</b>
- To generate log data continually, run the PowerShell ISE script (green play button) in the virtual machine

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7egoHi1.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="ip-geo"/>

> Data will be exported from Windows Event Viewer and imported into the IP Geolocation service by the script. The latitude and longitude will then be extracted, and a new log file called failed_rdp.log will be created in the location specified below: C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log

<h2>Step 9 : Log Analytics Workspace: Make a Custom Log</h2>

- To add the extra information from the IP Geolocation service to Azure Sentinel, create a custom log
- Search "Run" in VM and type "C:\ProgramData"
- Open file named "failed_rdp" hit <b>CTRL + A</b> to select all and <b>CTRL + C</b> to copy selection
- On the host PC, open notepad and paste the information
- Save to desktop as "failed_rdp.log" <b>Note:</b> make sure it's saved as a (.txt) text file. I had issues with formatting when saving in (.rtf) rich text format. 
- In Azure go to Log Analytics Workspaces -> Log Analytics workspace name (honeypot-law) -> Custom logs -> <b>Add custom log</b>

<h4>Sample</h4>

- Select Sample log saved to Desktop (failed_rdp.log) and click <b>Next</b>

<h4>Record delimiter</h4>

- Look over sample logs -> Click <b>Next</b>

<h4>Collection paths</h4>

- Type: Windows 
- Path: "C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log

<h4>Details</h4>

- Name and describe the custom log (FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO) before pressing the <b>Next</b> button
- Click <b>Create</b>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4LSqrhI.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="customlog"/>

<h2>Step 10 : Query + Extract Fields from Custom Log</h2>

- Navigate to the newly established workspace (honeypot-law) in Log Analytics Workspaces -> Logs
- We then can run a query and extract the different data filtering by different fields such as latitude, longitude, destinationhost, etc.

> As of March 31st, 2023, Microsoft has disabled the creation of new custom fields and has migrated to KQL. You can learn more about it <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-fields-migrate"> here</a>

- Copy/Paste the following query into the query window and Run Query

```kql
FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL 
| extend username = extract(@"username:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         timestamp = extract(@"timestamp:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         latitude = extract(@"latitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         longitude = extract(@"longitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         sourcehost = extract(@"sourcehost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         state = extract(@"state:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         label = extract(@"label:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         destination = extract(@"destinationhost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         country = extract(@"country:([^,]+)", 1, RawData)
| where destination != "samplehost"
| where sourcehost != ""
| summarize event_count=count() by timestamp, label, country, state, sourcehost, username, destination, longitude, latitude
```

> Kusto Query Language (KQL) is used to query and extract logs from data stored in Azure Log Analytics or Azure Data Explorer. KQL is a powerful and expressive query language that allows you to perform advanced data analysis, filtering, aggregation, and visualization. With some practice composing questions and simple instructions, the language is meant to be simple to read and use.

<h2>Step 11 : Create World Attack Map in Microsoft Sentinel</h2>

- Access Microsoft Sentinel to view the Overview page and available events
- Click on <b>Workbooks</b> and <b>Add workbook</b> then click <b>Edit</b>
- Delete default widgets (three dots -> remove)
- Click <b>Add</b>-><b>Add query</b>
- You can Copy/Paste the previous query or this one into the query window and <b>Run Query</b>

```kql
Failed_RDP_Geolocation_CL
| parse RawData with * "latitude:" Latitude ",longitude:" Longitude ",destinationhost:" DestinationHost ",username:" Username ",sourcehost:" Sourcehost ",state:" State ", country:" Country ",label:" Label ",timestamp:" Timestamp
| where DestinationHost != "samplehost"
| where Sourcehost != ""
| summarize event_count=count() by Sourcehost, Latitude, Longitude, Country, Label, DestinationHost
```
- When results appear, select <b>Map</b> from the <b>Visualization</b> drop-down box.
- Choose <b>Map Settings</b> to make additional adjustments

> Data processing from a custom Powershell script using a third party API

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5Q08fjL.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="ps-logs"/>

<h2>Step 12 : Shut Down Resources</h2>

>CRUCIAL: DON'T SKIP !

- Look for "Resource groups" -> name of resource group
- Key in the name of the resource group (honeypot-lab) to verify removal of resources
- Select the <b>Apply force delete for selected Virtual machines and Virtual machine scale sets</b> box
- Click <b>Delete</b>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kTsdh5M.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="dpvs-resources"/>

> Resources will use free credits if they are not eliminated, and costs may start to accrue.
