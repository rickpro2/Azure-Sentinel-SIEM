# Cybersecurity Lab: Azure Sentinel and Honeypot Setup
<img src="images/Title Logo.png"/>

## Overview


In this cybersecurity lab, I set up a cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Azure Sentinel and a Virtual Machine Honeypot. I observed live cyberattacks, including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute-force attempts, originating from various locations worldwide.

To enhance the analysis, I utilized a custom PowerShell script to retrieve the geolocation data of the attackers and plotted their locations on the Azure Sentinel Map.

This project was inspired by the invaluable guidance provided in the YouTube video <a href="https://youtu.be/RoZeVbbZ0o0?list=PL85GlCRx5t-Lo3Z5aoSFwozqEkuQtuRmk" target="_new">"SIEM Tutorial for Beginners | Azure Sentinel Tutorial MAP with LIVE CYBER ATTACKS!</a>" by Josh Madakor. The video's step-by-step instructions, practical demonstrations, and clear explanations played a crucial role in setting up Azure Sentinel and deploying the Virtual Machine Honeypot.
